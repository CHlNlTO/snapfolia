Kapre or ogre is described as giant dark, hairy, and muscular creatures that usually smoke big pipes. They are mostly seen sitting under the trees. Kapres are believed to be nocturnal and omnivorous. They are not necessarily considered to be evil. However, they may turn vengeful when the tree that they are inhabiting is cut down. They may make contact with people to offer friendship, or if they are attracted to a woman. If a Kapre befriends a human, especially because of love, the Kapre will consistently follow its "love interest" throughout life. Also, if one is a friend of the Kapre, then that person will have the ability to see it and if they were to sit on it then any other person would be able to see the huge entity.',

Nearby trees boasted about their flowers, making ylang-ylang feel even worse. One stormy day, the flowering trees prepared to protect their blooms. Meanwhile, two woolly worms sought shelter but were turned away by the flowering trees. Ylang-ylang, having no flowers to protect, offered the worms a home and food from its leaves. After the storm, ylang-ylang found its worm friends had transformed into beautiful butterflies. The goddesses, impressed by ylang-ylang's kindness, rewarded the tree with fragrant flowers resembling the butterflies' folded wings. From then on, ylang-ylang became known as the \"flower of flowers\" for its sweet scent, admired by all.",

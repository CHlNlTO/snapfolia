Kapre or ogre is described as giant dark, hairy, and muscular creatures that usually smoke big pipes. They are mostly seen sitting under the trees. Kapres are believed to be nocturnal and omnivorous. They are not necessarily considered to be evil. However, they may turn vengeful when the tree that they are inhabiting is cut down. They may make contact with people to offer friendship, or if they are attracted to a woman. If a Kapre befriends a human, especially because of love, the Kapre will consistently follow its "love interest" throughout life. Also, if one is a friend of the Kapre, then that person will have the ability to see it and if they were to sit on it then any other person would be able to see the huge entity.',

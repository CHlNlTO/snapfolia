              The philippine myth starts with pangga, a beautiful daughter of an old couple. Pangga fell for a local poet who was known as a full fledged sweet talker who could promise the sun, moon and stars named manong who also love pangga. Pangga’s parents disagree with their love. But Manong and Pangga sought to stubbornly keep their love vows till their dying day. Then, the Philippine myth says, one day they disappeared in the woods. The Philippine myth ends with a discovery of a new kind of tree. Its fruit was a bit crescent-shaped like the moon, yellow like the sun, and sweet like Manong’s tongue. It was rich in nutrition as Pangga’s multi-faceted genius. In time it was called “Manga,” a mix of their names, and today’s vernacular for mango.

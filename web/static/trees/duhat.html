        <h2 class="color-dgreen fw-bold">Botany</h2>
        <p class="color-dgreen ps-2 pe-3">
          Duhat is a smooth tree, about 8 to 15 meters high with white branchlets and reddish young shoots. 
          Leaves are opposite, shiny and leathery, oblong-ovate to elliptic or obovate-elliptic, 6 to 12 
          centimeters long, the tip being broad and shortly pointed. Panicles are borne mostly from the 
          branchlets below the leaves, often being axillary or terminal, about 4 to 6 centimeters long. 
          Flowers are small, numerous, scented, pink or nearly white, in clusters, without stalks, borne 
          in crowded fascicles on the ends of the branchlets. Calyx is funnel-shaped, about 4 millimeters 
          long, and 4-toothed. Petals cohere and fall all together as a small disk. Stamens are numerous 
          and about as long as the calyx. Fruit is oval to elliptic, 1.5 to 3.5 centimeters long, dark purple 
          or nearly black, luscious, fleshy and edible with a sweet astringent taste; containing a single large seed.

          <p class="color-dgreen ps-2 pe-3">
            Be careful when passing the Duhat tree because it is known as a common dwelling place for Engkantos  â€“ especially the Pugot, or the headless priest. The mixture of Duhat, ginger, mansanitas bark, yantok, blood and makahiya leaves are used as an offering to the mandurugo, a known blood sucking creature of Philippine lower mythology that disguises herself in the day as a beautiful woman.
          </p>
          <p class="color-dgreen ps-2 pe-3">
          The Pugot (literally meaning "decapitated one") is a mythological demon found in the Ilocos area. It may take on numerous forms such as hogs, dogs, and even people. It generally appears as a dark, massive headless creature. The monster is frequently seen in gloomy regions or abandoned dwellings. They prefer to live in trees such as duhat (Eugenia cumini), santol (Sandoricum koetjape), and tamarind.
          Aside from shapeshifting, the pugot can travel at breakneck speed, preying on snakes and insects it finds in the treetops. It feeds by inserting food into its neck stump.
          </p>
          <p class="color-dgreen ps-2 pe-3">
          Despite its menacing appearance, the pugot is generally harmless. The monster, on the other hand, is fond of women's underwear and snatches them when they are drying on a clothesline.

                  Bayabas is a somewhat hairy plant reaching a height of 8 meters. Young branches are 4-angled. Leaves are opposite, oblong to elliptic, 
                  and 5 to 1 centimeters long, the apex being pointed, and the base usually rounded. Peduncles are 1- to 3-flowered. Flowers are white, 
                  3 to 3.5 centimeters across, with in-curved petals, coming out solitary or two to three in the leaf axils. Numerous stamens form the 
                  attractive part of the flower. Inferior ovaries develop into round or obovoid green fruits 4 to 9 centimeters long, turning yellow on 
                  ripening and have edible, aromatic, seedy pulp.

                      The Myth of the Guava Fruit

                      Once upon a time, in a lush countryside orchard, there lived a kind and friendly boy from the Abas family. This boy was so generous that the locals began calling him "Bay," a term for exceptionally kind people. Over time, he became known as Bay Abas.
                      Bay Abas had a special place in his heart for the needy. Whenever someone came to the orchard asking for fruit, he generously gave from the abundant trees. Remarkably, the orchard bore more fruit than any other in the area, and new trees mysteriously sprouted, adding to its bounty.
                      However, one tree in the orchard was different. It had hard wood, wide-spreading branches, and bore inedible fruits even at low levels. No one dared to eat its fruit, fearing its reputed toxicity.
                      One day, an old woman came by, asking Bay Abas for some fruit. Unfortunately, the orchard was bare, except for the forbidden tree. Feeling compassionate, Bay Abas whispered a wish or a prayer, hoping to find a way to help the woman. His wish reached the ears of the forest gods. Miraculously, the fruit of the forbidden tree turned edible just before he took his first bite.
                      From that day on, the fruit became known as "bayabas," or guava, in honor of Bay Abas. The once-poisonous fruit turned into a nutritious and delicious treasure, reflecting the multi-faceted kindness of Bay Abas.
                      And so, the guava fruit, rich in nutrients and flavor, serves as a reminder of the boundless generosity and compassion of a boy named Bay Abas.

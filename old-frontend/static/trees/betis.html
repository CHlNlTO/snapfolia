            The Myth of the Betis Tree:
            In the heart of the Philippines, amidst the vibrant landscapes and lush forests, stands the majestic Betis tree. This towering tree, with its rough bark and broad canopy, has been a silent witness to countless stories and legends passed down through generations.
          </li>
          <li class="color-dgreen">
            The Guardian of the Forest:
According to ancient folklore, the Betis tree is not just any tree but a revered guardian of the forest. It is believed that powerful spirits, known as "diwata," reside within its branches and roots. These diwata are protectors of nature, ensuring the balance and harmony of the forest. Villagers often approach the Betis tree with respect, offering prayers and small gifts to appease the spirits and seek their blessings.
          </li>
          <li class="color-dgreen">
            The Tree of Wisdom:
Elders tell the tale of a wise and elderly diwata named Lakan, who chose the Betis tree as his dwelling. Lakan was known for his profound knowledge and wisdom. He would often whisper secrets of the forest and guidance to those who sat beneath the tree, listening to the rustling leaves. It is said that if you approach the Betis tree with a pure heart and open mind, Lakan might reveal hidden truths and offer guidance for life's challenges.
          </li>
          <li class="color-dgreen">
            The Healing Powers:
The Betis tree is also known for its miraculous healing properties. Stories abound of its leaves and bark being used to create potent medicinal concoctions. Healers and shamans often seek the tree's aid to cure ailments and drive away malevolent spirits. One famous legend tells of a young girl named Amihan, who was gravely ill. Her desperate parents prayed to the Betis tree, and Lakan appeared in their dreams, guiding them to brew a potion from the tree's bark. Miraculously, Amihan recovered, and from then on, the tree was revered as a source of healing.
          </li>
          <li class="color-dgreen">
            The Protector of the Innocent:
Another cherished myth tells of a time when a tyrant threatened a peaceful village near the forest. The villagers, fearing for their lives, sought refuge beneath the Betis tree. As the tyrant's men approached, the tree's branches grew denser and more intertwined, creating an impenetrable barrier. The diwata Lakan, angered by the injustice, summoned a storm that drove the tyrant and his men away, protecting the innocent villagers.
